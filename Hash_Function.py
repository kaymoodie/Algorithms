It has been my obsession with becoming a Software Developer over ten (10) years ago and I decided to revisit programming once again. My ultimate goal is to leave my 9 to 5 job and pursue my passion for developing software specializing in Web Applications and working remotely. I am at the stage of deciding on what is my main language or framework to solidify my path. Currently, I am learning Python and enrolled in a web development Bootcamp on Udemy. My passion is programming, for several reasons, the main of which is the jubilation of having your ideas rendered into reality on the screen. Another is being able to provide solutions for improving existing and new business processes and even life. Another reason I am working diligently on becoming a successful Software Developer; is that I can make a significant contribution to my society both professionally and personally. Ultimately encouraged my peers and children to get into Information Technology (IT). As well as having the experience and influence to assist Governments and NGOs in improving the IT infrastructure of my country. I look forward to meeting IT personnel from various sectors and countries as part of my professional journey. For collaboration, cooperation, and innovation, thus providing each other with a wealth of information and knowledge. And in so doing making my career dreams come true."
